## Repository contents:
Several code lists were used to help find diagnosis of COVID-19 and identify persons considered "at-risk" of severe COVID-19 outcomes. 

The codelist used to identify COVID-19 diagnosis in primary and secondary care can be found in the **Diagnosis** folder. This folder contains the _CovidDiagnosisCodelist.xslx_ file which contains READ_V2, SNOMED, and ICD-10 codes associated with COVID-19. 

The codelists used to identify the "at-risk" population are found in the **GreenBookComorbidities** and **Medications** folders. The at-risk population is defined by the UK Green Book, which lists Comorbidities that would place patients at high risk of Severe COVID-19.
The **Medications** folder contains the _SevereRespiratoryPrescriptionCodelist.xslx_ which contains READ_V2 prescription codes to identify patients with Severe Asthma. 
The **GreenBookComorbidities** folder contains codelists featuring READ_V2, SNOMED, and ICD-10 codes associated with the comorbidities used to identify patients with high risk of severe COVID-19, as defined by the UK Green Book:
